This game is little bit more advanced than Princess Knightinghamm. It is called Galxy Defiance and I developed it with the help of Heratbeast YouTube channel.

It was so fun and a little bit more challenging because we did it with components which were separated to the assets. Throughout this tutorial, I got familiar with the game engine itself,
which in this case is Godot 4.3. I realized how components work, we dived deeper into the animating the ship and enemies and also we did a little bit of coding in GDScript.
