# Welcome to Galaxy Defiance!

This game has been developed using Godot 4.3 and components. Below you can finde the YouTube link to the course in case you want to try it out by yourself. 

Here is the list of topics I have managed to do during this course:

- Animate the spaceship, enemies, bullets and hot the enemies behave when they get hit and destroyed. Also, some of the enemies about how they go down on the screen and have different behaviours when they are moving.

- Coding. In this part, I have learned how to implement animation with object oriented coding, how to set some behaviours for the enemies and the main spaceship and also how to treat each object as a separate entity, yet a part of the game.

- Design. I have implemented some designs for the background, animating the stars for the background and also make them to generate as long as the game is running. Designing UI and HUD and also set sprites and textures for the each object of the game, including the enemies, the spaceship and bullets that it shoots.

I have learned valuable lessons and topics while following this course and dived deeper into the world of Godot and game design.

This game is available on Windows, Linux, and web browsers on top of this very page.
